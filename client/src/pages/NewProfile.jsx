            content={`I wanted to share something that happened today and get your take on it.

Me and my girlfriend were travelling in the Delhi Metro. She recently got into Indigo as a flight attendant, and today was her medical test. We had to leave early around 7 AM, and both of us didn‚Äôt get much sleep.

On our way back, I was tired and had my head resting on her shoulder. At one point, I jokingly rubbed my nose on her shoulder because I had a bit of a cold ‚Äî nothing over the top, just a small moment between us.

An uncle sitting next to us suddenly said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do this. You don‚Äôt have etiquettes. This is a public place. Don‚Äôt you have elders at home? Would you do this in front of them?‚Äù

I calmly tried to explain that I wasn‚Äôt doing anything inappropriate, but he kept insisting. Then another uncle joined him and told me to shut up and stop arguing. I told them I was being respectful and only trying to explain my side.

Honestly, it spoiled my mood. I wasn‚Äôt trying to make a scene or offend anyone ‚Äî just tired and sharing a peaceful moment with someone I care about.

Was I wrong here? How do you usually deal with moral policing like this in public spaces?

Would really appreciate some honest thoughts`}
